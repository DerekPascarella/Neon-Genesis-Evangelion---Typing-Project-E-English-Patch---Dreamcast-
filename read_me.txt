.----------::[ Patching Instructions ]::----------
|
| 1) Copy TOSEC-style GDI files (gdi+raws+bins) to the "gdi" folder.
|
| 2) Drag the "gdi" folder onto the "extract_gdi.bat" file.  A new folder called
|    "gdi Extracted" will be created.  This folder contains all of the data files
|    from the game.
|
| 3) Copy all of the files from the "patched_files" folder to the "gdi Extracted"
|    folder, choosing to overwrite existing files when prompted.
|
| 4) Drag the "gdi Extracted" folder onto the "build_gdi.bat" file.  A small black
|    window will open stating that the GDI build process has begun.  Once it has
|    completed, a success message will appear before the window automatically
|    closes after a few seconds.
|
| 5) The GDI files (gdi+raws+bins) in the "gdi" folder are now ready for use.

.------------::[ Release Notes ]::-------------
|
| I’m very proud to release the very first version of my English translation
| patch for “Neon Genesis Evanglion – Typing Project E” for the Sega
| Dreamcast!  Thanks to a very active community, The Dream™ never dies and I
| want to give my most heartfelt “thank you” to each and every person who
| is passionate about Sega’s farewell console.
| 
| In this initial release (version 1), all menus, options, dialog boxes, and
| screens have been fully translated.  Levels 1 through 4 have also been fully
| translated, with the exception of a few short sequences of spoken dialog.
| Levels 5, 6, and the bonus level have only had their menus, dialog boxes and
| screens translated.  However, the levels are not yet playable by a
| non-Japanese speaker.  My goal is to complete a playable version of those
| levels for version 2.  Allow me to elaborate with more detail…
| Part of what made translating this game so attractive to me is the majority
| of the game being QWERTY-keyboard friendly, where an English speaker with
| access to the standard Dreamcast keyboard is able to play and complete each
| level.  Some levels use English words for their word bank, others use the
| Romanji spellings of Japanese words.  In either case, the game is fully
| playable.
| 
| However, the previously mentioned levels (5, 6, and bonus) instead present
| the player with words written in a mixture of Kanji and Katakana/Hiragana.
| The game then expects the player to use the key combinations necessary to
| produce the series of Katana/Hiragana characters that construct one Kanji
| character.  It’s obvious how challenging this is from a translation
| perspective.  There are two approaches to solving this:
|
|   1) Display the English alphabet letters that correspond to each Katakana,
|      Hiragana, and Kanji character that the player is asked to type, this way
|      they can easily key in the correct sequence of letters in order to
|      successfully complete the word.  The challenge here is fitting the
|      English letters into the space provided on-screen for each character.
|      This is the most straight forward solution as of right now and will
|      likely be polished and implemented in version 2.
|   2) Reverse-engineer the game to either:
|        a. Display as many English letters as I’d like for each Katakana,
|           Hiragana, or Kanji character.
|        b. Use entirely custom word banks that would allow for me to avoid the
|           Japanese character problem altogether.
|
| At this time of this release, I have not been successful in either of these,
| and of course I welcome any and all contributions from others in the
| community with more experience in this area.
|
| It’s also worth mentioning that level 5 allows the player to “cheat” by
| pressing Enter to display the Katakana/Hiragana equivalent of each Kanji word
| to be typed.  As it is much simpler to fit the two or three English letters
| into the space provided for each Katakana/Hiragana character, I initially
| believed that level 5 could be solved in this manner.  However, I quickly
| discovered that by cheating, the player is awarded no points for that
| individual word, thus leaving them with no way to progress.
|
| Lastly, the "WEBPAGE" option on the title screen takes you to a browser that
| displays a website that's stored directly on the disc.  While the browser's
| menu and all of the site's pages are translatable, it's a very low priority
| for me (for obvious reasons).
|
| In summary, this game is extremely playable.  I have had a lot of fun on this
| project and so you can expect a second and final version to be released once
| I overcome the previously mentioned challenges.  I hope you enjoy the game!
